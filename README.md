Consider the fact that every commit message is whatever the last spoken sentence I just
happened to overhear at the time of having to write my commit message, be it from something
on the TV, a lyric from a playing song, a genuine "OH", or a random thought that passed through
my head.

Conclusion: If the phrase "pre-alpha" referred to the "cenozoic era", this code
base would be "the electroweak epoch" (this code base is exceptionally young.
If you'd like to play with something more stable than this code base, consider

# install (needs node.js and npm, obviously)
npm install -g grunt

npm install -g bower

npm install
bower install

```
# build
grunt build

# build documentation
grunt docco
```

Make more JS friendly:
```
- C++ initialization is tailored for synchronous file loading:
    - load 'player-options.json'/options file
    - load 'english.json'/string table file
- resource cache is designed for filesystems/zip files, not xhr requests
- instance exports for `eventManager` and `eventFactory` are mimicing C++ globals.
```
